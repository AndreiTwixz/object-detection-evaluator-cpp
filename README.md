  Developed a C++ performance evaluation tool designed to validate the accuracy of object detection models by comparing "Hypothesis" predictions against "Ground Truth" references. Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the application implements the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric to measure the spatial overlap between bounding boxes. The system utilizes a specific coordinate-based logic ($x_2 - x_1 + 1$) for pixel-precise area calculations and automatically classifies results as True Positives (TP) or False Positives (FP) by evaluating object labels (e.g., "caine", "pisica") against user-defined IoU thresholds. The final output provides a Precision score that quantifies the overall reliability of the detection system.
